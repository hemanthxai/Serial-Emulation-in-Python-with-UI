Install the required libraries using the following commands:
1) PyOpenGL (for OpenGL): 
pip install PyOpenGL
2) glfw (for creating windows and handling input): 
pip install glfw
3) imgui (for ImGui bindings):
pip install imgui[glfw]
4) pytest (if not already installed for testing): 
pip install pytest


Note: Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Python 3.7.4 installed via pyenv and Socat 1.8.0.1. This version of Python ensures proper functionality for libraries like pyimgui and glfw, which require this specific version to work correctly.
